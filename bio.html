        <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>I was born in Zurich, Switzerland, in May of 1993.  Shortly after, my dad's work
                moved our family to Nashville, TN, where we lived for several years.  When I was
                about 7 years old, we moved again to Greenville, SC, which is where we remained
                and where I did most of my growing up.  When I was younger I experimented with many
                different sports including baseball, basketball, and soccer.  I really stuck with
                soccer and played competitively up until I started high school.  I also took lessons
                on the guitar and drums.</p>

        <h3>High School</h3>
            <p>I attended Mauldin High School in Mauldin, SC.  Through all four years I was very 
                involved in the school's marching band as a member of the drumline.  After just
                one year I was given a leadership position, and maintaned the role of section 
                leader for the next three years.  I learned a great deal about leadership and 
                teamwork during this time, and had a great time doing it.</p>

        <h3>Drum Corps / WGI</h3>
            <p>From 2010 to 2013, I was a member of two world class competitive drumlines.  Palmetto
                Percussion was an indoor percussion group that practiced and competed on the weekends
                during the winter.  In 2010, we won overall in our class and were bumped up to become
                a world class group, where we competed for the next two seasons.</p>  

            <p>The Cadets is a drum corps that I was a member of in 2012 and 2013.  Instead of just a
                drumline, a drum corps also has a brass section, colorguard, and front ensemble.  150
                members and countless other staff/volunteers lived together for the entire summer,
                traveling across ~25 different states in buses and competing across the country.  In 
                2013, we won the High Percussion award and the corps came in 3rd overall.  This was an
                extremely rewarding experience.  I learned a lot about hard work, discipline, and 
                dedication.</p>

        <h3>College</h3>
            <p>After attending Greenville Technical College for a couple of years, I transferred to 
                Clemson University to study Computer Science. I have learned so much here and I have
                really developed a love for computer programming and software development.  Other than
                being a student, I have also worked for the university as 1) a teaching assistant in
                a computer science lab, and 2) an intern at Clemson Online, where I built and maintained
                different parts of the school's website.</p>

        <h3>Hobbies & Interests</h3>
            <p>In my free time I enjoy watching/playing sports, spending time with my friends, and listening
                to good music.  My girlfriend, Alex, is studying to become a veterinarian at the Virginia-
                Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine.  I recently purchased a Raspberry Pi and have been
                tinkering and working on a few different projects with it.  I am an avid fan of 
                motorsports, especially Formula 1.  I also love to travel... I have family in Germany and
                Switzerland who I like to visit as often as possible.</p>
